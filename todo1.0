Atom stanza? Should stanzas for plugins go in sleekxmpp.stanza or sleekxmpp.plugins.stanza?

sleekxmpp.stanza __all__ out of date?

stanza.error could be cleaned up, use _delSubText, etc

stanza.htmlim could use _delSubText, etc. Why not msg['html']['body'] instead of msg['html']['html']?

Unify timeout values - maybe xmlstream.stanzabase.TIMEOUT?

Need to use registerStanzaPlugin in rootstanza instead of the manual steps

Is exceptions.XMPPError raised anywhere? grep says no, is it still needed?

Extra tostring method in xmlstream. Maybe modify the tostring/ packages to accept a stream and top namespace instead of assuming a stanza object? Change ElementBase __str__ to pass its stream object to new function instead of extending ToString.

Move tostring and tostring26 to be a single package with import switch in a __init__.py that selects appropriate file to import.

Remove thread remains from handler classes.

Clarify what is meant by 'instream' for a handler.

Allow for XPath matching to use basic [@att="value"] filter. <- eek? Alternative is to use xml mask, but those are longer. 

ElementBase sub_items not subitem?

Only import cElementTree in stanzabase, everything else reference that. Would make using lxml instead of cElementTree easier if needed.

*XMPP needs to use JID class instead of lots of fields.

BaseXMPP set_jid, makeIqQuery, getjidresource, getjidbare not needed

Is BaseXMPP.send used anywhere?

Make top level examples folder, put example.py, component_example.py there. Maybe even the disco browser too.

__getitem__ should be in BaseXMPP. get too, or remove it?

xmlstreammod in ComponentXMPP can be removed, just use XMLStream.

Why CamelCase and underscore_names? Document semantics.

Make the common classes available using __init__.py

Need to unit test stanzabase/elementbase. Heavily.

conn_tests and sleekxmpp/tests and sleekxmpp/xmlstresm/test.* -> convert to either unit tests, or at least put in same place

Update setup.py - github url, version #



-- PEP8 - all files

Need to use spaces

Docstrings are lacking. Need to document attributes and return values.

Organize imports

Use absolute, not relative imports

Fix one-liner if statements

Line length limit of 79 characters
