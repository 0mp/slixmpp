SleekXMPP is an XMPP library written for Python 3.x (with 2.6 compatibility).
Featured in examples in XMPP: The Definitive Guide by Kevin Smith, Remko Tronçon, and Peter Saint-Andre

SleekXMPP has several design goals/philosophies:
- Low number of dependencies.
- Every XEP as a plugin.
- Rewarding to work with.

The goals for 1.0 include (and we're getting close):
- Nearly Full test coverage of stanzas.
- Wide range of functional tests.
- Stanza objects for all interaction with the stream
- Documentation on using and extending SleekXMPP.
- Complete documentation on all implemented stanza objects
- Documentation on all examples used in XMPP: The Definitive Guide

1.1 will include:
- More functional and unit tests
- PEP-8 compliance
- XEP-225 support

Since 0.2, here's the Changelog:
- MANY bugfixes
- Re-implementation of handlers/threading to greatly simplify and remove bugs (no more spawning threads in handlers)
- Stanza objects for jabber:client and all implemented XEPs
- Raising XMPPError for jabber:client and extended errors in handlers
- Robust error handling and better insurance of iq responses
- Stanza objects have made life a lot easier!
- Massive audit/cleanup.
